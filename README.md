This Repo will hold all the links and resources I am using to be able to create an Automatic Water Tap using a sensor!

## Equioment I need: 
*  Solenoid Water Valve (12V)
* Arduino Board/Rasberry Pi
* Ultraonic Sensor Modulo
* 
## Questions/Things I am concerned about:
1. Firstly I am concerned about how am I going to connect the wires with different electric pieces?
2. What is relay? And Why do I need it? How does it help me with what I am trying to accomplish? 
3. Instead of using Arduino, would I be able to achieve with a Rasberry pi? 
4. Will I be able to write my script in Python? 
5. How will I solder all the wires? How will I make sure that I connected the jumper wires with the right input?
6. How am I going to be able to get water from (hot + cold) through the Solenoid Valve?
7. I am wondering how will the code in Arduino will run? What will trigger the file where my code might live?
8. What are the IN & OUT size for my Solenoid Valve? Does it need to be 1/2? 1/4? 3/4? 3/8? [Think about how will you be getting the watet in the Valve]
